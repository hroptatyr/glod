advantages. A rift between Apple and TBWA\Chiat\Day, which worked
together on the company’s Orwellian Super Bowl ad in 1984, once
would have been unthinkable, said Regis McKenna, a technology
marketing consultant who introduced agency founder Jay Chiat to Steve
Jobs in the early 1980s. Apple began creating the ads in-house a few
months after marketing chief Phil Schiller considered ending the
company’s relationship with Media Arts Lab in January 2013,
according to an e-mail from Schiller disclosed in April as part of a
lawsuit with Samsung Electronics Co. Media Arts Lab had created iconic
Apple campaigns for iPods and Macs, yet Schiller wrote that it
hadn’t effectively countered Samsung ads that cast Apple as stodgy

company has also brought in veteran advertising executives from other
agencies, such as Wieden+Kennedy’s Bill Davenport. Bessette declined

TBWA\Chiat\Day parent Omnicom Group Inc., declined to comment on the
companies’ relationship. Agency Management TBWA\Chiat\Day also
changed day-to-day management of Media Arts Lab earlier this
year. President James Vincent, who led the relationship with Apple
since the unit was created, was promoted to CEO, yet is no longer
involved in day-to-day operations of Media Arts Lab, according to a
person with knowledge of the change. This person said the transition
was unrelated to problems with Apple. Erica Hoholick, a former Media
